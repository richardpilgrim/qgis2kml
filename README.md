qgis2kml convert active vector layer in QGIS to kml file using QGIS style

This is a project to convert qgis2kml to work with QGIS 2.0.
This involves removing deprecated API calls and replacing them with updated calls.

Stalled at the moment due to lack of test file to work with. If you have any data you want me to test it then please send it on :)
